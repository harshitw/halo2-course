# Introduction

This book is a course on [Halo2](https://github.com/zcash/halo2) development and PlonKish arithmetization in general.
The indended audience is Rust developers who have a vague understanding of succinct proofs in general,
but no specific knowledge of Halo2, PlonK or developing circuits for zkSNARKs.

The book was created a collaboration between [ZKSecurity](https://zksecurity.xyz) and
 the [Zircuit](https://www.zircuit.com/) development team.
